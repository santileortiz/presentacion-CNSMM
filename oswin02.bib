abstract="Order types are a means to characterize the combinatorial properties of a finite point configuration. In particular, the crossing properties of all straight-line segments spanned by a planar n-point set are reflected by its order type. We establish a complete and reliable data base for all possible order types of size n=10 or less. The data base includes a realizing point set for each order type in small integer grid representation. To our knowledge, no such project has been carried out before.",
